As observed in another issue with respect to SSE security is whether the scheme
is secure against adaptive chosen-keyword attacks CKA2 or only against
non-adaptive chosen keyword attacks CKA1 The former guarantees security even
when the clients queries are based on the encrypted index and the results of
previous queries The latter only only guarantees security if the clients
queries are independent of the index and of previous results
