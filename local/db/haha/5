To search for a keyword w the client generates a search token tw and given tw r
and c the server can find the identifiers Iw of the files that contain w from
these identifiers it can recover the appropriate ciphertexts cw notice that the
provider learns som limited information about the clients query in particular
it knows that whatever keyword is being searched for is contained in the files
encrypted as Cw There are ways to hide even this information most notably using
the work of Goldreich and Ostrovsky on oblivious RAMs but such an approach
leads to inefficient schemes
