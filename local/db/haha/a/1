In Figure 1 we show the data structures of our fully-dynamic
SSE scheme for a specific index The index is built on three documents namely f1
f2 f3 over three keywords namely w1 w2 w3 all the documents contain keyword w1
keyword w2 is only contained in document f2 and w3 is contained in documents f2
and f3 the respective search table Ts the deletion table Td the search array As
and the deletion array Ad are alse shown in Figure 1 Note that in a real DSSE
index the would be padding to hide the number of file-word pairs we omit this
padding for simplicity in this example
